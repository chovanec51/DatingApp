Entity framework - is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM). It's job is to translate our code
    into SQL commands that update our tables in the db.
    We add entity framework by adding an important class that derives from the DB context class. This
    class acts as a bridge between our domain(entity classes) and our db. It is a primary class we use
    for interacting with our db.
    We will write link queries that will be translated into SQL commands.

Entity class - class that represents a table in the db.
